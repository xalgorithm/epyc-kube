# Grafana Dashboard Cleanup Guide

## Steps to Clean Up Dashboards

1. Log in to Grafana at https://grafana.xalg.im using your credentials from Vault.

2. From the left sidebar, click on "Dashboards" to access the dashboard browser.

3. Review each dashboard by clicking on it to open. Look for the following signs that a dashboard doesn't have data:
   - Empty panels with "No data" messages
   - Panels with error messages like "Error querying datasource" 
   - Dashboards without any panels
   - Dashboards with panels that have no datasource configured

4. To delete a dashboard that doesn't have data:
   - Click on the dashboard settings (gear icon) in the top right
   - Scroll down to the bottom and click the red "Delete Dashboard" button
   - Confirm the deletion

5. To identify which dashboards are provisioned (automatically managed by Kubernetes):
   - Look for the "save" icon in the top navigation
   - If it's disabled or has a lock icon, the dashboard is provisioned
   - Provisioned dashboards cannot be deleted through the UI and are managed by the system

## Alternative Method using Vault

If you prefer to delete dashboards directly from the command line, you can use this secure approach:

\`\`\`bash
# Set up port forwarding
kubectl port-forward -n monitoring svc/kube-prometheus-stack-grafana 3000:80

# Get credentials from Vault in another terminal
ADMIN_USER=\$(vault kv get -field=username secret/grafana/admin)
ADMIN_PASSWORD=\$(vault kv get -field=password secret/grafana/admin)

# List all dashboards
curl -s -u "\$ADMIN_USER:\$ADMIN_PASSWORD" http://localhost:3000/api/search?type=dash-db | jq

# Delete a specific dashboard (replace DASHBOARD_UID with the actual UID)
curl -X DELETE -u "\$ADMIN_USER:\$ADMIN_PASSWORD" http://localhost:3000/api/dashboards/uid/DASHBOARD_UID
\`\`\`

## Best Practices

- Don't delete system dashboards that are part of your monitoring stack
- Focus on removing custom dashboards that are no longer in use
- Consider organizing dashboards into folders for better management
- Tag dashboards to help with organization and identification
- Never hardcode credentials in scripts or documentation

Remember that some dashboards might appear empty if the data source is temporarily unavailable, so check the data source status before deleting.
